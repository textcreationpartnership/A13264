            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For mine owne part, I haue euer thought curioſity in diuine affaires but a quaint diſtraction, rather applauding an humble (yet faithful) ignorance, than a proud and temerarious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And had ſome of the Fathers beene ſhot-free of this curious inſolence, they needed not haue retreated from former Tenents, &amp; ſo much indeared poſterity, no leſſe in the reuiew than retractation of laborious errors: Amongſt whom <hi>S.

A poſition that doth not onely repugne the diſcipline of holy ſtorie, but thwarts the maine tide &amp; current of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox antiquity, as in a fuller diſcourſe we ſhall diſplay anon: and therefore in his 7.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1115:32"/> and 23, where he doth peach his ſometimes ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and ingeniouſly declares himſelfe, that—<hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum diligentius quaeſiuit, nec inuenit myſteria,</hi> he had not yet throughly ſifted that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. That there was a <hi>remnant according to the election of grace,</hi> which, if it did flow from a foreſeene merit, was rather reſtored than giuen, and therefore (at laſt) he informes his owne judgement, and his Readers thus; <hi>Datur qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem fideli ſed data eſt etiam prius ut eſſet fidelis;</hi> Grace is given to the faithfull, but it is firſt given that he ſhould be faithfull, Hence <hi>Lumbard</hi> in his 1 booke, 41 diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, pathetically, <hi>Elegit quos voluit Deus gratuitâ miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiâ, non quia fideles futuri erant, ſed ut eſſent, nec quià crediderant, ſed ut fierent credentes.</hi> God out of the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of his will, and bounty of his goodneſſe, hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen whom he pleaſed, not becauſe they were faithfull, but becauſe they ſhould be, and not of themſelues beleeuing, but made ſo.

Here the Pelagian ſtartles, &amp; lately backt with a troope of Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, takes head againſt this truth, fancying and dreaming of certain cauſes without God, which are not ſubſiſting in God himſelfe, but externally mouing the will of God to diſpoſe and determine of ſeuerall euents, laying this as an unſhaken principle, <hi>Fidem eſſe conditionem in obiecto eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibili ante electionem;</hi> That faith and obedience (fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene of God in the Elect) was the neceſſary condition and cauſe of their election. I intend not here a pitcht field againſt the vpſtart Sectarie, for I ſhall meet him anon in a ſingle combat: my purpoſe now is to be but as a ſcout, or ſpie, which diſcouers the weakneſſe of his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, not ſtands to encounter. And indeed both the time and place ſuggeſt me rather to reſolue, than debate; and convince, than diſpute an errour. That faith then, or any praeexiſting merit in the perſon to be elected, was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1115:33"/> the cauſe of his election, is neither warrantable by reaſon nor primitiue Authoritie. For God could not foreſee in the elect any faith at all, but that which in after times he was to crowne them with, and therefore not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as any precedent cauſe of election, but as the effect and fruit, and conſequent thereof.</p>
                     <p>The primary and chiefe motive then is that <gap reason="foreign">

And if we commerce a little with paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of holy ſtory, we ſhall find that our election points rather to the free will of God in his eternall councell, than to any goodneſſe in vs which God foreſaw: ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. where we read of the Gentiles, that many <hi>beleeued</hi> becauſe they were <hi>ordained</hi> to eternal life, and not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ordained</hi> becauſe they formerly <hi>beleeued.</hi> And if we will not ſuffer our minds to bee tranſported either with ſcruple or noueltie, the text is open, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He hath choſen vs before the foundations of the world were laid, that we might be holy, not that we were.</hi> And in this very Chapter, <hi>verſe</hi> 23.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1115:33"/> which if it did carry any ſhew either of probabilitie, or truth, we might queſtion our Apoſtle, who in his 8 here, and 29. no leſſe perſwades, than proues, that thoſe which God foreknew he did predeſtinate to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd</hi> to the image of his ſonne, and therefore God did not chuſe vs, becauſe before election there was a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie</hi> in vs, but becauſe from all eternitie he did elect vs, in time he made us <hi>conform'd</hi> to the image of his Sonne. Whereupon S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his fift booke, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Iulianum,</hi> 3. <hi>chapt.</hi> thus, <hi>Nullum elegit dignum, ſed eligendo effecit dignum.</hi> God in the choiſe of his Elect, found none worthy, but in the chuſing made them worthy. Moreover, our election, which is of grace (as I yonder proued) could not ſtand if workes and merits went before it. <hi>Haec quippè non inuenit meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, ſed facit;</hi> Grace doth not find works in vs, but faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons them, according to that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>God hath from the beginning choſen you through ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit, and not of works.</hi> Nay, ſome here ſo much aboliſh and wipe off all claime of merit, that they admit not Chriſt as the <hi>meritorious</hi> cauſe of our election.

Indeed, in the 3 of <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. we finde a —<hi>ſic Deus dilexit,—God ſo loued the world that he gaue his Sonne.</hi> So that, not becauſe Chriſt died for vs, God loued, and choſe vs, but becauſe God loued and choſe us, therefore Chriſt died for vs. For ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>God ſetteth out his loue towards vs, that whilſt we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for vs.</hi> In matters therefore of election, we acknowledge not a cauſe more claſſicke than the <hi>Cuius vult</hi> here ſpecified, <hi>He will haue mercy on whom he will.</hi> Inſomuch that in the parable of the houſholder, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.

For proofe whereof, a ſweet ſinger of our Iſrael inſtances in thoſe wonderfull paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of creation, where 'tis firſt ſaid that <hi>Deus creauit,</hi> God created all things, and the <hi>Valdè bonum</hi> comes aloofe, he ſaw that they were all good, and the morall portends but this, That euery thing is therefore good, becauſe it was created, and not therefore created becauſe it was good; which doth waſh, and purge the will of the Almighty from any ſtaine, or tincture of iniuſtice; for though that be the chiefe mover and director of all his proiects, as the prime and peremptory cauſe, doing this, becauſe hee will, yet we finde not onely <hi>ſanctitatem in operibus,</hi> but <hi>juſtitiam in vijs.

Hence 'tis, that the dimneſſe of humane apprehenſion conceaues that (oftentimes) a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency in God, which is the monſter of our own frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; making God not onely to foreknow, but predeſtinate an euill, when the euill is both by growth, and concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ours, and if ought ſauour of goodneſſe in vs, Gods, not ours, yet ours too, as deriuatiue from God, who is no leſſe the Patron of all goodneſſe, than the Creatour, and 'tis as truly impoſſible for him to commit euill, as 'twas truly miraculous to make all that hee had made good.

For as in things naturall (it is <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſimilitude) when all the firſt matter is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, why one part of it ſhould be vnder the forme of fire, another vnder the forme of earth, there may be a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon aſſigned, that there might be a diuerſity of <hi>ſpecies</hi> in things naturall: but why this part of matter ſhould be rather vnder the forme of fire, and that vnder the forme of earth, depends only on the ſimplicity of Gods will; &amp; as it hangs too on the wil of the Architect, that this ſtone ſhould be rather in this part of the wall, and that in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, although reaſon and art require that other ſtones ſhould be in one part of the Edifice, &amp; other in another.

Why God therefore doth ſaue ſome men, there is more to be alleaged than this, God would haue them to be ſaued; for if this laurell doe beautifie our triumph we muſt encounter, hee that will haue this Crowne muſt tug for it, and this prize, muſt wreſtle, <hi>Qui creauit te ſine te, non ſaluat te ſine te.</hi> He that hath created thee without thy ſelfe, will not ſaue thee without thy ſelfe. And therefore thoſe whom God from all eternity hath deſtined to ſaluation, hee hath in a like priuiledge deſtined to the meanes: But why thoſe meanes, not communicable to all, many a buſie endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour hath ſtrugled for a reaſon, not compaſt it. Out of more than a double Iurie of Interpreters, which I haue (not with a little diſtraction) obſerued, wauing here in doubtfull opinion, <hi>Hugo de Sancto <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictore</hi> giues thus his verdict. Gods grace is indifferently exhibited to all men, to the elect and reprobate, but all doe not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually lay hold on it. Some no leſſe neglect, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe Gods grace, and when its comfortable beames ſhall ſhine vpon them, they ſhut their eies againſt it, and will not behold it, and God in iuſtice with-drawes his grace from theſe men, becauſe they with-draw themſelues from his grace. <hi>Eſt enim in gratiâ quemadmodum in ſolis radio</hi> (ſaith he) There is a proportion betwixt the raies of the Sunne, and the eie, and betwixt the ſoule of man, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1115:37"/> the grace of God. The eie is ordained by nature to be the organ of the ſight, and yet the eie cannot ſee except the Sunne enlighten it; neither can the Sunne make any thing elſe ſee but the eie in man, for it may ſhine vpon our hand or foot, neuertheleſſe the hand or foot ſhall ſee nothing: ſo the ſoule hath a poſſibility to merit by her naturall abilities, but that poſſibility ſhall be vaine and fruitleſſe, vnleſſe it be quickned by the powerfull opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods grace, which grace, if it ſhall once actuate it, then the ſoule will be able to attaine to that double life of grace here, of glory hereafter. <hi>

But this inference is many ſtories aboue my reach, and in the greenneſſe of my iudgement, there is little truth in the conſequence, and palpable contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the conſequent. For how can the merits of man challenge any thing, if all flow from the grace of God? Yes (ſaith <hi>Hugo</hi>) euen as a weake child which cannot yet goe alone, ſhould be led by the Nurſe, a man cannot ſay that the childe goeth of himſelfe, but by the aſſiſtance of the Nurſe; and yet the Nurſe could not make the childe goe, vnleſſe he were naturally inclinde to that motion: ſo the ſoule of man is ſaid to merit by the aid of grace, and by her owne naturall inbred ability, but all the glory of the merit muſt be aſcribed to God, becauſe the ſoule can doe nothing without the ſupport and grace of God. Whence I can gather no truth but this, that in <hi>ſolo homine ſit petentia logica ad ſalute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> That a man only maybe ſaued without apparant contradiction; no vnreaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of that euerlaſting bleſſedneſſe and beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall viſion; and the ſoule of a beaſt is no more able to ſee God, than a ſenceleſſe ſtocke to behold a viſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. For man onely hath a paſſiue power to ſaluation, and man before his conuerſion hath a paſſiue power on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And therefore the ſimilies afore propoſed, if they be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1115:38"/> referred to the ſoule before the conuerſion, are falſe, and beare no proportion, for then the ſoule is ſtarke blinde, and dead in treſpaſſes, and cannot looke on the grace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, or moue one iot in the courſe of Chriſtianity: But after the conuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when God ſpeaks <hi>Ephata</hi> to the ſoule, be opened, when the vnderſtanding is illuminated, and ſcales of errour once drop from the eies, then it may hold ſome correſpondency with truth. As therefore in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our conuerſion, ſo of election too, all hangs on Grace, and this grace in a holy reſeruation limited to a narrow Tribe, for the <hi>cuius vult</hi> here inſinuates no more, and <hi>He will haue mercy on whom he will,</hi> ſounds in a direct aequiualence with this, <hi>He will haue mercy</hi> onely on ſome; of which ſome there is a definite and ſee num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, vncapable of augmentation, or diminution, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thoſe new ſprung Sectaries,<note place="margin">Arminians.</note> out of a turbulent braine and thirſt of cauillation, blaſpheme the eternity of Gods decree, making our election mutable, incompleat, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionate, ſubiect to change and reuocation, and what other ſtranger birth and prodigie of opinion, which I conceiue not without a holy impatience and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And whereas our Fathers of old haue maintained, euen to the ſword and fagot, the decree of election to be no leſſe eternall than irreuocable, theſe would faine lull our beleefe with innouation of vpſtart diſcipline, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering no leſſe the number than the condition of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect into the ſtate of reprobate, and of the reprobate into the elect. And (as the Deuill did to Chriſt) they vrge Text and reaſon for it. For God (ſay they) cannot giue grace to whom he doth giue grace, which if hee ſhould doe an elect may be damned; and hee can giue grace to him he doth not giue grace too, which if he doe, a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate may be ſaued, and ſo a reprobate may become an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and an elect a reprobate. Thus they ſhoot by an indirect aime, and ſaile by a wrong Compaſſe, for wee enquire not here of Gods power, but of his will, not what
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1115:38"/> he can doe, but what he hath reſolued to doe. Againe, it ſeemes no conſequence, God can ſaue or damne a man, therefore this man can be ſaued or damned,<note place="margin">Hugo de Sancto Victore in cap. <hi>9.</hi> ad Rom.</note>

No, for though this be too ragged and ſtonie for a popular capacity to digge through; yet if wee looke backe a little into the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Gods decree, wee ſhall finde that which will no leſſe relieue our vnderſtanding, than remoue our ſcruple; where things from euerlaſting haue ſuch a doome, which is not malleable either by change or reuocation, <hi>For the Lord of hoſts hath determined, and who can diſanull it? and his hand is ſtretched out, and who can turne it away?

Againe, that grace of Illumination is more peculiarly confined, and if by the beames of that glorious Sunne which enlightneth euery man that comes into the world, we attaine to the knowledge of the Scripture, yet the bare knowledge doth not ſaue vs, but the application. But the grace of regeneration is not onely a ſufficient, but an effectuall grace, and as 'tis more powerfull, ſo 'tis more reſtrained; they onely partake of this bleſſednes, whom God hath no leſſe enlightned, than ſanctified, and pointed out, then ſealed, men inueſted in white robes of ſinceritie, whoſe delinquencies, though ſometimes of a deepe tincture, are now both diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed with, &amp; obliterated, not becauſe they were not ſinfull, but becauſe, not imputed: ſo inuolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous, and hidden are Gods eternall proiects, that in thoſe he relinquiſheth, or ſaues, his reaſon, is his will; yet that as farre diſcoaſted from tyranny, as iniuſtice.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1115:41"/> but if they ſuruiue, they are nouriſhed in Paganiſme, infidelitie, which are the beaten roades and highwayes to deſtruction. And if we ſcan (ſaith he) the nicety of theſe words, the obtaining of reconciliation to be applied, and the application of reconciliation obtained, wee ſhall finde it a meere curioſitie to barrow and perplex the braine, and torture the vnderſtanding, ſince Chriſt hath neuer obtained that which he hath not applied, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath he applied that which he hath not obtained. Yet theſe men either of a head-ſtrong opinion, or learned madneſſe, are ſo violent in the proſecution of their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, that no ſtrength of anſwer will ſatisfie their obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor modeſtie of language ſuppreſſe their clamour, but a foule mouthed <hi>Forſterus</hi> will bray out his witty ſpleene with an —<hi>Error, &amp; furor Zuinglianorum.</hi> His reaſons are as ſlender as they are many (the vertigoes and impoſtures of a giddie braine) fitter for ſilence, than rehearſall, and for ſcorne than confutation. Wee apply then; Is grace vniuerſally bountifull, and mercy open-breſted vnto all? What meane then thoſe Epithites of outcaſt, curſed, damned, and that triple inſcription of death, hell, and damnation? are they either of pollicie or truth? Are they things reall, or fancied onely to bug-beare and awe mortalitie? What would the Throne por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend? Iudge, aduerſarie, Sergeant, priſon, or thoſe horrid tones of worme, fire, brimſtone, howling, gnaſhing? Is the Scripture the Anuill of vntruth, or are theſe things no more than faigned and imaginary? What will thoſe flames of your threatned purgatory proue at laſt, but the Chimaera and coinage of a phantaſticke braine? And a 500 yeares indulgence, but the ſharke and legerdemaine of your Lord God the Pope? Either your opinion is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or your priſon, both which muſt fleet with your holy Fathers honour, if the armes of mercie be expanded to all. Againe, are the merits of Chriſt appliable to all? Sweare, whore, drinke, prophane, blaſpheme, and (if there

Thinkeſt thou that heauen was euer guiltie of ſuch treaſon againſt her Soueraigne? or that it will euer entertaine a gueſt ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the height of diſſoluteneſſe and debauſhment? No, thou muſt know that one day there will be a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſummons, either at thoſe particular accounts, at the houre of Death, or at the generall audit of the laſt trumpe, when thou ſhalt meet with a new Acheldema and vale of Hinnom, places no leſſe of terror than of torment, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery dungeon, and the burning Tophet, where the fury of the great Iudge reaks in a floud of brimſtone, and his reuenge boiles in a firy torrent, limitleſſe, and vnquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. On the other ſide happily maiſt thou ſlumber, without howle, or skreeke of conſcience, thou wounded and deiected ſpirit; Thou whoſe glorious ornaments are but ſackcloth and aſhes, and thy choiſeſt fare but the bread of ſorrow and contrition.

Behold, how thy Sauiour comes flying downe with the wings of his loue, and ſweepes away thy ſinnes that they ſhall neither tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally ſhame thee, nor eternally condemne thee.

How then can wee without ſacriledge, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of diuine honour, make God the father of ſo foule and vnwaſhed a crime?

To lay then (with ſome depraued libertines) the weight and burden of our ſinnes on the ſhoulder of Predeſtination, and make that the wombe of thoſe foule enormities, may well paſſe for an infirmity, not for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and indeed thus to ſhuffle with diuine goodneſſe, is no leſſe fearefull, than blaſphemous. For, though God from eternity knew how to reward euery man, either by crown, or puniſhment—.<hi>Nemini tame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aut neceſſitate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, aut voluntatem intulit delinquendi,</hi> yet he neuer enioyned any man either a neceſſity, or a will to ſinne.

To loue then his children, and neglect his enemies, doth neither impaire Gods mercy, nor impeach his iuſtice. But why God ſhould loue this as his childe, neglect that as his enemy, <hi>Nec poſſible eſt comprehendere, nec licitum inueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare</hi>—, is beyond all lawfulneſſe of enquirie, all ken of apprehenſion. Let this then ſatisfie our deſire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>Et ab illo eſſe, quod ſtatur, &amp; non eſſe ab illo, quod ruitur:</hi> That his prouidence is the ſtaffe and crutch on which we ſo leane that we yet ſtand; our corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the bruzed and broken reed on which, if wee doe leane, we fall. If any ſtagger at thoſe vnfathomed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and his reaſon and apprehenſion be ſtrooke dead at the contemplation of Gods eternall, but hidden pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, let him ſeaſon a little his amazement with adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and at laſt ſolace his diſtempered thoughts with that of <hi>Gregory, Qui in factis Dei, &amp;c.</hi> In the abſtruſe and darker myſteries of God, he that ſees not a reaſon, if he ſees his own infirmity, he ſees a ſufficient reaſon why he ſhould not ſee.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1115:44"/> eye of curioſitie prying too nicely into the cloſet of Gods ſecrets, are no leſſe dazeled than blinded; if not with profanation, hereſie. Diuine ſecrets ſhould rather tranſport vs with wonder, than prompt vs to enquiry, and bring vs on our knees to acknowledge the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe both of Gods power and will, than ranſacke the boſome of the Almighty, for the reuealing of his intents. Is it not bleſſedneſſe enough that God hath made thee his Steward, though not his Secretarie? Will no Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in heauen content thee, but that which is the throne and chaire for omnipotency to ſit on? No treaſury, but that which is the Cabinet and ſtore-houſe of his own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets? Worme, and no man, take heed how thou ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt with thy Maker; expoſtulation with God imports no leſſe peremptorineſſe, than danger; and if Angels fell for pride of emulation, where wilt thou tumble for this pride of inquiry? As in matters therefore of vnuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all doubt, where truth hath no verdict, probability finds audience, So in thoſe obſtruct and narrow paſſages of his will, where reaſon cannot informe thee, beleefe is thy beſt intelligencer, and if that want a tongue, make this thy interpreter; ſo thou maiſt euade with leſſe diſtruſt, I am ſure, with more ſafety.</p>

Others there are (whoſe opinions bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der neerer vpon truth) which would haue God to be ſaid to harden —<hi>non effectiue, ſed permiſſiuè;</hi> Not by way of Action, but permiſſion, and ſo <hi>Damaſcen</hi> in his third booke <hi>de fide Orthodoxâ, cap.</hi> 20. Where his words run thus. <hi>Operaepretium eſt agnoſcere</hi>—. 'Tis a matter no leſſe worthy of knowledge, than obſeruance, that 'tis the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1115:45"/> cuſtome of the Scripture to call Gods permiſſion, his action. So we reade that God ſent his enemies the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſlumber, which is not to be aſcribed to God as an agent, but as a permitter. This gloſſe ſutes well with the approbation of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> who ſpeaking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally of that of the firſt of the <hi>Romanes, Deus tradidit illos</hi>—God gaue them vp vnto vile affections, hee there expounds —<hi>tradidit,</hi> by <hi>permiſit,</hi> which he thus illuſtrates by a ſimilitude—; As the Generall of an Armie, in the ſweat and brunt of a bloudy day, if he withdraw his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall directions from his ſouldiers, what doth he but expoſe them to the mercie of their enemies? not that he led them into the iawes of danger, but becauſe they were not back't by his encouragement: So God in this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conflict, he deliuers vs not into the hands of our arch-enemie, he leaues vs to our owne ſtrength, and our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections drag vs thither with a witneſſe. And hence that dicotomy of <hi>Caietan</hi> claimes his prerogatiue, that God doth harden <hi>Negatiuely,</hi> but not <hi>Poſitiuely,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> diſtinction though it be ſound &amp; Orthodox, yet it doth not exempt vs from ſcruple, for God hath more in the ſtiffeneckt and peruerſe, than a naked and bare permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, otherwiſe we ſhould too weakly diſtance obduration from a leſſer ſinne, for euery ſinne God permits, and as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his <hi>Enchir.</hi> 96. <hi>cap. Nihil fit niſi om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotens fieri velit, vel ſinendo vt fiat, vel ipſe faciendo.</hi> There's nothing done without the conſent and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Almightie, and that either by his perſon or ſubſtitute. If God therfore be only ſaid to harden man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he permits him to be hardened, why ſhould he not be likewiſe ſaid to ſteale, becauſe he permits man to ſteale? No doubt therefore but God hath a greater ore in this ſinne of hardneing, than in offences of a leſſer bulke. And therefore Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 3. <hi>lib. cont. Iulianum,</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> with many a ſinewed allegation proues, that God doth concurre to the excaecation and hardening both of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1115:45"/> the minde and heart,—<hi>Non ſolum, ſecundum patientiam, &amp; permiſſionem, ſed potentiam, &amp; actionem.</hi> Not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his patience and permiſſion onely, but his power and action: Which poſition hee thus (after) qualifies with a diſtinction. <hi>Obduration</hi> is not onely a <hi>ſinne,</hi> but a <hi>puniſhment</hi> of a ſinne. Now, that which is in obduration meerely of ſinne hath it's pedegree and originall from man onely; but that which is of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for that ſinne, from God. And therefore I cannot but approue of that of <hi>Iſiodore, Qui iuſti ſunt, à Deo non impelluntur, vt malifiant, ſed dùm mali iam ſunt, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur, vt deteriores exiſtant,</hi>— According to that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.

You ſee then that <hi>death</hi> and all <hi>corporall defects,</hi> were ſcourges following the diſobedience of the firſt man, not occaſioned by any impulſion or languiſhment of <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> will reaſon it thus, —<hi>If a man for an offence be depriued of ſome benefit that is giuen him, the wanting of this benefit, is the puniſhment of that offence. To Adam in his ſtate of innocency there was this boone conferr'd from Heauen, that as long as his minde was ſubiect vnto God, the inferiour powers of the ſoule ſhould be obedient vnto reaſon, and the body vnto the ſoule. But, becauſe the minde of man (by ſinne) did recoile and ſtart backe from this diuine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, it followed, that thoſe inferiour powers alſo would not be totally ſubiect vnto reaſon; whence grew ſo great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of the carnall appetite, that the body (too) would not be totally ſubiect to the ſoule. Vpon this breach death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and all that pale band of diſeaſes, and corporall infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for the incollumity and life of the body conſiſts in this, that it be ſubiect vnto the ſoule, —Sicut perfectibile ſuae perfectioni,</hi>— as the Schooleman ſpeakes, <hi>as a thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectable to its perfection. On the other ſide, death and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and languiſhments of body, haue reference to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the true ſubiection of the body, to the ſoule. And therefore neceſſity of conſequence will induce, that, as the rebellion of the carnall appetite to the ſpirit, was a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our firſt fathers ſinne, ſo, mortality, and all corporall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1115:78"/> imperfections too,</hi> as the Schooleman punctually in his 2<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. 2ae. 164. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Artic.</hi> The curſe then due to the lapſe of our firſt Parents houers not ouer the <hi>ſoule</hi> onely, but, for it, the <hi>body;</hi> the <hi>body</hi> (before) in a bleſſed way of incorruptibility, but, not <hi>of it ſelfe,</hi> but <hi>from the ſoule,</hi> ſo <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tells his <hi>Dioſcorus, —Tam potenti naturâ Deus fecit animam, vt ex eius beatitudine, redundet in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, plenitudo ſanitatis, &amp; incorruptionis vigor</hi>—in his 56 Epiſtle. His body then was not indiſſoluble by any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of immortality exiſting in it ſelfe, but there was (ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally) a power in the ſoule, diuinely giuen, by which man might preſerue his body from all corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as long as it remained ſubiect vnto God. And the Schooleman hath good ground for it; for, ſeeing <hi>the reaſonable ſoule doth exceed the dimenſions and proportion of corporall matter, it was conuenient, that, in the beginning, there ſhould be a vertue giuen it, by which the body might be reſcued from all infirmities, and conſerued aboue the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that corporall matter,</hi> as the ſame <hi>Aquinas par.</hi> 1. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 97. <hi>Art.</hi> 1.

                     <note place="margin">Aquinas.</note> and the Schooleman is at hand too, with a diſtinction for a two-fold death, one, <hi>as an ill of humane nature, or a defect incident from mans tranſgreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that, he dares not lay on the Almighty,</hi> the other, <hi>as it hath ſome ſpecies or reſemblance of good, to wit, as it is a iuſt penance for his rebellion,</hi> this he doth in his 2<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. 2ae. 164. <hi>quaeſt.

                  <p>As therefore in the creation of the world God is ſaid to <hi>make light,</hi> and to <hi>ſeparate it from darkneſſe,</hi>
